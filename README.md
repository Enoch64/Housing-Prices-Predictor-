# Housing Prices Predictor
## Project Description 
This program builds a linear regression model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median housing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). The algorithms, data set splitting and error analysis like cross-validation were implemented with inbuilt functions and methods from Sci-Kit Learn. Matplotlib was used to visualize and investigate the geographical data.
